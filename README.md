# GoTracing Project

This is a ray tracing project which is based on golang.

The purpoes of the project is just for me to learn golang.

# What's the next

Now GoTracing can render some simple objects. But ray tracing is a complex system, I can't finish it in a short time. So I will make a Todo list.

1. using configuration file to describe scene
2. add local coordinate system for object
3. rebuild the camra and view plane
4. and so on

## Example

* some objects in one scene
![example](./img/example.jpg)

* object in different light color
![object in different light color](./img/differentLightColor.jpg)
